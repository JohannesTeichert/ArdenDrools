# ArdenDrools

Aim of this project is to provide a working prototype for the usage of arden syntax and functionality together with the business rule engine Drools. 

The goal for the future is also to implement an interpreter or compiler to translate existing arden mlms to java classes and drools rules. 

Source and project structure is very likely to change a lot.

#### This is a work in progress
